OBFS 2019 - Determining the data and cyberinfrastructure needs of modern Field Stations and Marine Laboratories (FSMLs)

**Dates** – Sept 10th, 2019 \
**Times** - 9am - 1pm \
**Location** – OBFS 2019 meeting, Belgium \

## Workshop Description
Field stations are excellent sources of long-term ecological data, but making that data easily usable, accessible, and stable comes with significant cyberinfrastructure challenges. NCGAS is an NSF-funded center to help genomics researchers grapple with similar problems, and we are looking to expand our free services to include field stations. In this workshop, we seek to identify common issues in field station data management and cyberinfrastructure and discuss means by which to approach common issues. We plan to focus on FSML experience with both data problems and currently available solutions through guided small-group discussion of current opinions, followed by synthesis discussion to generalize these problems across participating groups. We would then explain our current services and capacities in developing and providing tools, access to national infrastructure, and free education. The focus here would be to provide a jumping off point for approaching outstanding data issues. With both problems and NCGAS's capacities outlined, we hope to conclude by identifying up to five specific case studies to address in the coming year. Case studies will be chosen with the goal of having solutions broadly useful to other FSMLs with similar issues.

## Intended audience 
Field stations with data in-house, that are facing data and cyberinfrastructure challenges
